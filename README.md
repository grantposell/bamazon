This is a Node.js application that uses MySQL to create a command line Amazon-like environment. 

Upon starting up the application, the user is prompted with what products they would be interested in purchasing. 

The user choses the product by selecting the id by using arrow keys.

Next, the customer choses the quantity by inputing a numerical value. The application checks to see how much of each quantity exists and will reject a request if over the quantity.

Finally, the application displays the product purchased and the total cost. Then, it subtracts the amount from the quantity in the database as well. 

Below is a demonstration of the application.
